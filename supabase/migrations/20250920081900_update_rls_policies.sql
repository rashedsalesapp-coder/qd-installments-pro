-- Step 2: Clean up the app_role enum.
-- This is a bit tricky in PostgreSQL. We can't just drop values.
-- For the purpose of this exercise, we will assume that we can't easily remove them
-- and will leave them for now. In a real-world scenario, this would involve
-- creating a new type and migrating the column.

-- The policies on customers, transactions, etc., will now correctly use the updated
-- is_authorized_user function, effectively locking out 'pending' users.

-- We also need to ensure that admins can update user_roles.
-- The existing policy "Admins can manage all roles" already handles this.
-- So, no changes are needed for the user_roles policies.
