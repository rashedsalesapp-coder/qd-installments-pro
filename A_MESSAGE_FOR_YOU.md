Hello,

My apologies for the confusing messages and tool errors. The system is having trouble sending my messages correctly.

I am creating this file to give you the final, clear instructions.

You asked which file to run. You are correct that in my last update, a file was renamed.

The final and correct file you need to run is located at this path:

**`supabase/migrations/20250923112000_definitive_fix_migration.sql`**

Please copy the entire contents of that single file, paste it into your Supabase SQL Editor, and click "Run".

This is the last step. Once that script runs successfully, all the application errors should be resolved.

Thank you for your incredible patience.
